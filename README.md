# QR-Code-Recogniser
Given a picture of a QR code, this python program detects and recognises the QR code shown in the image.
This program features theoretical knowledge that I have learn from my Computer Graphics and Image Processing Paper (COMPSCI 373), in which I applied this knowledge into a practical apporach.
With the help of some skeleton code, I was able to create a program where given a picture of a QR code, it detects and recognises the QR code shown in the image.
